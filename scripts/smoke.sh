# smoke.sh — drive stethoscope-mcp over stdio with real JSON-RPC and check the replies.
#
# No MCP client required. A stdio MCP server is just a process that reads
# newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdin and writes it on stdout, so a pipe is a
# perfectly legitimate client. Needs jq; nothing else.
#
# Usage: scripts/smoke.sh [path-to-binary]     (default: target/debug/stethoscope-mcp)
#
# Build with `cargo xtask dev`: storage_health runs an embedded probe, which a
# plain `cargo build` does not carry. The server runs with HOME pointed at a
# scratch directory, so the probe it places never lands in your own home;
# scripts/prologue/ covers placement and refusal in detail.
