//! The read guard: the one place that decides which paths this server may read
//! the *contents* of as collected data.
//!
//! Every such read in the crate goes through [`crate::proc::read`] or
//! [`crate::proc::read_optional`], and both ask this module first. Two things
//! touch the filesystem outside its remit, on purpose, and neither puts file
//! contents in front of the model: `statvfs`, which the storage probe calls and
//! which returns fixed-shape capacity figures about a path (decision 36), and
//! the probe prologue
//! (`crate::prologue`), which hashes, places and executes probe binaries in
//! `/opt/stethoscope` and `~/.stethoscope` under rules of its own (decisions 32,
//! 38 and 40).
//!
//! The control is an **allowlist**, not a denylist. A denylist has to enumerate
//! every dangerous file forever, and it loses outright to renaming: a symlink at
//! `/tmp/x` pointing at `/proc/1/environ` has the basename `x` and passes any
//! check on basenames. An allowlist rejects `/tmp/x` because it is not a shape
//! this server reads. [`FORBIDDEN`] exists underneath it only so that widening
//! the allowlist carelessly still fails closed.
//!
//! Paths are normalized *lexically*, without touching the filesystem.
//! `std::fs::canonicalize` would resolve symlinks and `..` correctly but
//! requires the file to exist, which would turn every legitimately absent
//! optional file into a resolution failure rather than the "missing" answer
//! decision 18 rule 7 depends on. Rejecting `.`, `..` and empty components
//! outright is enough: the server's paths never contain them, so their presence
//! is either a bug or an attempt to get around this function.
//!
//! A denial is always a programming error — no path here is model-controlled —
//! so the tests at the bottom of this file, and the CI job that flags any edit
//! to it, are as much of the control as the runtime check is.
