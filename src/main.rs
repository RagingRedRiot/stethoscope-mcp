//! stethoscope-mcp — a local stdio MCP server providing constrained, read-only observability.
//!
//! See `docs/internal/` for the architecture and decision log. The single
//! most important rule: this server gives the model *capabilities*, never
//! arbitrary command execution.
//!
//! This file is deliberately the whole model-facing surface: every tool the
//! server exposes is declared here, and the bodies do nothing but validate the
//! target and delegate. You can read one short file and enumerate exactly what
//! this server can do.
//!
//! NOTE: stdout is the MCP transport. Never `println!` here. Anything
//! diagnostic must go to stderr.
